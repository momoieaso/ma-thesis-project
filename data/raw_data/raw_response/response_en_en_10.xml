  <response id="1">
    People often feel sleepy in spring due to a combination of factors, including changes in daylight hours, temperature fluctuations, and seasonal allergies. As the days lengthen with more sunlight, the body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) can be disrupted, leading to feelings of fatigue. Additionally, warmer weather may promote a more relaxed state, making individuals feel lethargic. Allergens such as pollen can also contribute to tiredness due to the body's immune response, which may cause symptoms like nasal congestion and difficulty sleeping. Together, these factors can create a sense of sleepiness as the body adjusts to the seasonal transition.
